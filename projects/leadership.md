## Leadership and Outreach Through ACM Manoa

My college leadership and outreach experiences at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa centered around the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). ACM plays a major role in bridging the gap between students and Hawai‘i’s growing IT industry by providing opportunities for networking, professional skill development, and community building within the Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) department.

## Starting Point: Logistics, Facilities, and Security (LFS)

I started working with ACM as the Logistics, Facilities, and Security (LFS) officer in my freshman year. Managing the ICSpace, an interactive classroom in POST 318B intended for ICS students, faculty, and staff, was my main responsibility. This area was used as a lounge and a gathering place for Special Interest Group (SIG) meetings, providing an atmosphere that encouraged cooperation and education. I obtained practical experience in community building and operational management by keeping the ICSpace clean and welcoming.

## Moving Up: Operations Officer

I moved into the position of Operations Officer as my involvement grew. In this position, I helped plan important events like the General Meeting, the ACM Career Fair, and the Kekuhaupi‘o Tech Mentorship Program (KTMP). I collaborated with companies such as Google and Fast Enterprises to organize workshops that connected students and business professionals. My organizational abilities developed in this position, and this is where I learned how to forge connections between academia and business.

## Leading Teams: Operations Director

I was promoted to Operations Director after working as an Operations Officer. My duties here grew to include overseeing a group of operations coordinators. Strong planning and logistical supervision were essential to this leadership position, but so was mentoring and direction to make sure our team functioned as a team. I assisted SIG leaders in organizing their events, streamlined procedures, and made sure that funding requests and paperwork were handled effectively. My leadership shifted from completing tasks myself to enabling others to achieve.

## Current Role: Vice President of ACM

As of right now, I am ACM Manoa's vice president. I work with the President and other officers to plan initiatives, set priorities, and increase the impact of our chapter while also helping to strategically oversee the organization's operations. As Vice President, I have a special emphasis on sustainability and making sure that ACM keeps benefiting ICS students in the future by means of regular programming, solid community relationships, and industry involvement.

## Complementary Outreach: ICS Advising Team

In my sophomore year, I joined the ICS Advising Team in addition to ACM. Since both organizations strive to support ICS students, this position complemented my work with ACM. In order to assist students in dealing with course planning, opportunities, and resources, I took part in informational events, department fairs, and welcome days with advising.

## Impact and Reflection

I've had the honor of helping to build a more powerful and united ICS community through ACM and ICS Advising. I've gained leadership, communication, and organizational management skills throughout my time at UH, which has included everything from organizing career fairs to managing teams to maintaining student spaces. Most importantly, these experiences gave me the chance to support my peers by giving them chances to grow, connect, and excel.

## Use of AI Assistance

- I used ChatGPT (OpenAI’s GPT-5 model) to support the writing of this essay. Specifically, AI helped me with:

- Helping me refine my thoughts and points on the examples, so that my explanations were clearer and more complete.

- Suggesting polished language to make the report more professional and portfolio-ready.

- Providing editorial feedback on structure, clarity, and tone.

The final essay reflects my own experiences, growth, and voice, but I acknowledge that AI tools supported me in brainstorming, drafting, and polishing my work.
