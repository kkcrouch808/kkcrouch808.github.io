## Leadership and Outreach Through ACM Manoa
Introduction

During my time at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has been at the center of my college leadership and outreach experiences. ACM Manoa plays a vital role in bridging the gap between students and Hawai‘i’s growing IT industry, providing opportunities to build connections, gain professional skills, and foster community within the Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) department. My leadership journey in ACM reflects not only personal growth but also my commitment to strengthening the academic and professional pathways available to my peers.

## Starting Point: Logistics, Facilities, and Security (LFS)

As a freshman, I began my involvement with ACM as the Logistics, Facilities, and Security (LFS) officer. My primary responsibility was managing the ICSpace, an interactive classroom in POST 318B designed for ICS students, faculty, and staff. This space served as both a lounge and a hub for Special Interest Group (SIG) meetings, creating an environment where collaboration and learning could thrive. By maintaining the ICSpace and ensuring it remained welcoming and functional, I gained firsthand experience in operational management and community building.

## Growth in Responsibility: Operations Officer

As I became more deeply involved, I transitioned into the role of Operations Officer. In this position, I played an active role in planning large-scale events such as the ACM Career Fair, General Meeting, and the Kekuhaupi‘o Tech Mentorship Program (KTMP). I collaborated with companies including Google and Fast Enterprises to coordinate workshops that connected students with industry professionals. This role sharpened my organizational skills and taught me how to build partnerships between academia and industry.

## Leading Teams: Operations Director

After serving as an Operations Officer, I was appointed Operations Director. Here, my responsibilities expanded to managing a team of Operations Coordinators. This leadership role required not only strong planning and logistical oversight but also mentorship and guidance to ensure our team worked cohesively. I helped streamline processes, supported SIG leaders in hosting their events, and ensured that paperwork and funding requests were managed efficiently. My leadership became less about doing tasks myself and more about empowering others to succeed.

## Current Role: Vice President of ACM

Today, I serve as Vice President of ACM Manoa. In this position, I help oversee the organization’s operations at a strategic level, collaborating with the President and other officers to set priorities, plan initiatives, and strengthen our chapter’s impact. As Vice President, I am especially focused on sustainability—ensuring ACM continues to provide value to future generations of ICS students through consistent programming, strong community ties, and industry engagement.

## Complementary Outreach: ICS Advising Team

In addition to ACM, I joined the ICS Advising Team in my sophomore year. This role complemented my work with ACM, as both groups share the goal of supporting ICS students. With Advising, I participated in welcome days, department fairs, and informational events to help students navigate course planning, opportunities, and resources. This experience broadened my perspective, showing me how outreach extends beyond event planning to individual mentorship and guidance.

## Impact and Reflection

Through ACM and ICS Advising, I have had the privilege of contributing to a stronger, more connected ICS community. From maintaining student spaces to coordinating career fairs and managing teams, my journey has given me skills in leadership, communication, and organizational management. Most importantly, these experiences allowed me to give back to my peers, creating opportunities for others to grow, connect, and succeed.
