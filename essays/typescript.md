*This essay was written for my ICS 314 class at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The purpose of this assignment is not only to reflect on what I’ve learned, but also to write in a way that could be useful to someone outside the classroom—maybe even an employer curious about how I think about new tools and learning environments.*

## Adjusting to a New Language

Coming into ICS 314, I had already been coding primarily in Java, with some C++ and Python experience on the side. TypeScript, however, felt like it was playing by its own rules. On the surface, it looks a lot like JavaScript, but with training wheels—or maybe more like guardrails. The type system is there to catch mistakes before they spiral into bugs, which feels reassuring compared to JavaScript’s “try it and see if it breaks” attitude.

Compared to Java, TypeScript is less rigid and more forgiving, which can be refreshing but also confusing at times. C++ trained me to expect that every little detail would matter (and sometimes explode if I wasn’t careful), so TypeScript’s balance between flexibility and structure feels like a middle ground. Python, with its minimal syntax, still feels “friendlier,” but I can see how TypeScript scales better when working on larger projects.

## What I Actually Learned

I came into this module with some background in GitHub and a little web editing, but I had never built something like a professional portfolio from scratch. That project became my biggest takeaway—not so much TypeScript syntax, but the experience of building something that represents me online. I also found myself digging deeper into CSS than I ever had before, learning how small design choices completely change how “professional” or “unfinished” a site feels.

Another surprising lesson was learning how to bring AI into the process. I used it when I got stuck on CSS details, to explain modern JavaScript features like destructuring, and even as a second pair of eyes on my code. Knowing how to prompt AI effectively is becoming just as important as knowing how to search Stack Overflow, and this course gave me plenty of opportunities to practice that skill.

## TypeScript Through a Software Engineer’s Eyes

If I zoom out from being a student and imagine myself as a software engineer evaluating TypeScript, I think it’s a solid language for projects that need both collaboration and long-term maintainability. The typing system enforces discipline, but it doesn’t box you in as much as Java might. In other words: it’s strict enough to prevent chaos, but flexible enough to not feel like a straitjacket.

Would I want to build every project in it? Probably not. But for web apps that will be maintained and extended by teams, TypeScript seems like a strong choice.

## The WODs: Stressful but Useful

ICS 314 introduced me to the concept of WODs—Workouts of the Day. Basically, they’re timed coding challenges meant to simulate high-pressure, real-world problem solving. At first, they felt intense, and honestly, stressful. I found the practice WODs helpful, especially with the accompanying videos, but the videos are outdated, which limits their usefulness.

What would take WODs to the next level, in my opinion, is integrating AI guidance—learning how to prompt tools like ChatGPT effectively could be just as valuable as syntax drills. In the real world, professionals increasingly use AI as part of their workflow, so practicing that skill in class would mirror industry reality.

## My Style of Learning

The WODs exposed a truth about my own learning: I need a balance of guidance and pressure. Throwing me into a timed test without enough modern walkthroughs doesn’t feel effective, but pairing that stress with a big project early in the semester—like the portfolio—was extremely valuable. That project gave me something concrete to show for my time and effort, something I can actually point to as a representation of my skills.

So, do I enjoy this style of learning? Enjoy might be the wrong word—it’s more like training. It’s tough, sometimes frustrating, but ultimately it builds resilience. And if that’s what ICS 314 is trying to teach, then it’s doing its job.

## Writing With AI

One interesting twist to this essay is that I didn’t write it alone—I collaborated with AI. I used AI to help shape my thoughts into something more polished and professional, making sure the style matched the guidelines for technical writing. I see this less as “outsourcing” my work and more as learning how to prompt, refine, and edit with a tool that mirrors what many professionals already do in industry. This experience also ties into another essay I am developing about AI and schoolwork, where I explore the line between using AI as a shortcut versus as a learning partner. Writing this piece with AI’s assistance gave me first-hand insight into how that balance can work in practice.

## Closing Thoughts

Learning TypeScript while balancing WODs and projects hasn’t been easy, but it has been eye-opening. I’ve seen firsthand how a language can change the way I think about software engineering, how a project can sharpen my professional image, and how stress in the right doses can build real skills.

At the end of the day, TypeScript might not be my favorite language yet, but I can see its value—and I can see how this course’s unique approach will shape me into not just a better coder, but a better problem solver.
